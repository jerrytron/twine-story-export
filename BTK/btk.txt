You look outside the window. "WOW." There are a whole bunch of Raccoons stomping all over your backyard. Some are digging through your trash. One Raccoon is disconnecting cables, risking electric shock. He doesn't care.

[[Enough of this shit|Backstory]]


:: Rocks
You arrive at a very steep rock wall. You probably could not climb it without serious gear.

Near to the ground you see a small hole which is raccoon shaped. The hole is overgrown with weeds. It seems very dirty.

A black rope is coming out of the hole, it snakes across the ground and around the corner. <<if $big>>//You are in such a good mood that you don't mind getting dirty.//
You can [[Enter the hole|Hole]]<<else>>You wouldn't want to crawl in that dirty hole.<<endif>>

Follow the [[Black Rope|Fridge]]
Walk back to the [[Shore]]


:: Fridge
You follow the cord around the corner, over a bush, and scramble up a bunch of rocks.

The rope leads you to a Brodart refrigerator... Brodart... that sounds familiar, you think. You open up the fridge.

Inside are two solo cups, one red and one blue. They each have messages written in sharpie:

The red cup says "Get Huge". [[Drink it|BigCup]]
The blue cup says "Get Smaller". [[Drink it|SmallCup]]

<<if $appeal>>"I definitely connect with your brand" <<else>>"Chill."<<endif>> Bro Raccoon utters. He licks some peanut butter off of his inner thigh. "If you want the Raccoons to leave your turf, you have to talk to Raccoon King. He won't come out unless you complete a task.

[[What task|Task]]


:: Task
You sigh.

Bro Racoon reveals three rotting crimson meat steaks. He unwraps some twine from around his ankle.

"You must become naked and tie these various gross meats to your body."

[[Hell no|NoMeat]]
[[Do it|YesMeat]]


:: GoHome
You take the water taxi back to your apartment.

You unlock your door. "Shit." Your apartment is messed up by Raccoons. IKEA bookshelf all smashed, couch ripped up, trash can dumped all over the floor. "SPLORGE" is [[Graffiti'd|Graffiti]] on your living room wall.

"I need to send out that update or I'm fucked." you think. A tree branch crashes down in the backyard. You grab your keys and walk out of your apartment.

You hail a water taxi towards Raccoon Island, which is like Coney Island.

Get on the [[Water Taxi|WaterTaxi]]
<<set $big = false>>


:: SmallCup
You take a sip of the blue cup which says "Get Small" on it. This drink tastes like milk with some ice cubes in it.

You start to feel sad and bad about your Kickstarter

"Wow fine"

The three raccoons that slurped your meat jump up on a printer, a wooden spool, and a FOXCONN box. They turn around, their butts presented to you.

You get ready to kiss, but your lips are super chapped. You reach into your pocket, but shit, you forgot your Burts Bees at home.

"I'm super vegan" you say. "And I'm a grown ass man and [[I don't need this|NeedThis]]"

"If you like living with Raccoons I can respect that." Bro raccoon rifles through some trash and excavates a logitech webcam. He slurps some PB off the roof of his mouth "But if you want them gone this is your last chance."

[[Leave the cave|GoHome]]
[[Fine|YesMeat]]

You need this.

[[Back|NoMeat]]


:: WaterTaxi
The water taxi makes its way towards Raccoon Island. The taxi man speaks in trembling tone "There is a curse... of Raccoon Island" he says. 

[[Fuck the curse|Shore]]


:: Hole
You get down on your stomach and do an army crawl into the hole. You are feeling ripped as hell.

On the ground are a bunch of rat skulls, trash, and muscle t-shirts.

[[Muscle through|LairDark]]

You apply the Tiger Balm. There's a burn, but it's a healing burn.<<set $spicy = true>>

:: YesMeat
"Hand me the meats" you say with a no-nonsense attitude. Bro Raccon scurries down the trash pile, meats firmly in his gullet.

You strip down to your naturals. You raise your arms up as the raccoon applies the sloppy meat to your skin. A bird wraps the twine around you, securing the meats.

The webcam is on and pointed at you.

"Great. Now squat down and let these raccoons eat the meats off your body"

:: Shore
You arrive at the shore of raccoon island. It is sandy, with scratchy shrub bushes. The beach is practically covered in trash. There is trash everywhere, including plastic 6 pack rings that are uncut. 

There's a wooden crate nearby, and a rock wall up ahead.

Check out the [[Crate]]
Walk up to the [[Rocks]]


:: LairDark
Finally the tunnel opens up and there's nothing but [[Darkness]].

[[Flick on your lighter|LairLight]]


:: Darkness
"It's dark" you chirp. "But chill."

You can tell from the reverberation of your voice that this is a pretty big cave.

[[Flick on your lighter|LairLight]]


:: Butts
You lean in to kiss the first butt. The butt is remarkably furry & wild. Some butt hairs stick to your lips after smooching. You proceed to smooch the next two butts. The raccoons shiver a bit when they feel the hot air exhaled from your nose on their butt.

The Raccoon King closes his netbook. "Now my turn." He presents his butt. Wow. This butt is neatly shaved. It seems fresher than a normal raccoon butt. It has a few chunks of peanut butter on it, but otherwise immaculate.

<<if $spicy>>[[Kiss the butt|KissSpicy]]<<else>>[[Kiss the butt|KissNormal]]<<endif>>


:: EatMeat
Some raccoons surface on top of the trash pile. They slink down the detritus. "Damn"

The raccoons start nibbling the meats like a [[Slow Loris|http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18-xvIjH8T4]]. Tongues slurp all over your pecs. 

The last bit of steak is snatched off your body.

Your lighter sparks on and reveals a dank cave. There is an impressive pile of trash in the center. It smells like crap.

There is a throne at the top of the trash pile made of corrugated metal. The Raccoon King is sitting on it and his face is smeared with peanut butter.

"I'm not the Raccoon King." he says. "I'm his brother"

:: KissSpicy
You bring your lips to the King's hairless butt. You smooch into the cheeks. There is a slight hissing sound, then the King lets out a big ''YELP''!

The tiger balm! He jolts away from you. You can see the burn marks from your super spicy kiss.

"OW! You jerk!" He dips his hand into the peanut butter jar and rubs some on his butt. "No way I'm RT'ing a jerk like you! Instead I'm gonna post that [[naked gross meat video|MeatVideo]]!"

[[Apologize]]

You bring your lips to the King's hairless butt. You smooch into the cheeks.

The Raccoon King squeals in delight. "Is that cherry flavor?" he asks. "Yep" you reply.

The trash pile rumbles and shakes and various empty campbell's cans slide down the side towards your feet. A second, larger throne emerges from the trash pile with the Raccoon King lounging on top.

"What up" says the Raccoon King.

Tell him [[What's up|WhatsUp]]



:: Crate
You walk over to the crate. It seems like an everyday normal crate. You lift up the lid. A bunch of flies disperse. "Gross." 

At the bottom of the crate is a rotting steak, half chewed, shrinkwrap and styrofoam and all that.

[[Close the lid|Shore]]

"Your raccoons are fucking up my apartment, my Kickstarter, and my life." You're still naked. "Tell them to leave Brooklyn"

The King pulls out a netbook and opens the lid "I looked at your Kickstarter. It's def not gonna make it." Bro Raccoon nods. "But I have a //lot// of [[followers|TwitterProfile]]. I could retweet you."

You grit your teeth. "What do you want in return?"

''"Kiss the butts of three normal raccoons, then kiss mine."''

"Oh no, if people see that and they know about my Kickstarter they they will never fund it!" you fake concern.

"Oh yeah, //AND// I'm going to link it to your Kickstarter!" He sniffs. "They'll never crowdfund you!" The Raccoon King swipes furiously at the netbook trackpad.

"Done! Never mess with the Brooklyn Trash King!" He slams his netbook. "Kick him out of here!"

A bunch of raccoons scurry over and lift you up. Before you can fight it, they [[toss you back out through the hole|ViralEnding]].


:: Apologize
"Look sorry about your butt, I'm just addicted to this tiger balm stuff."

Raccoon King sighs "It's k, to be frank I kinda liked it."

The King pulls out his netbook, keeping his butt held high to air it out. "So what's your twitter name?"

"@torahhorse"

"Okay I retweeted you. Are you sure you wanna go back to your apartment? You could stay here, we got wifi.."

[[I would like that|StayHere]]
[[Nah, I gotta get home|GoHome]]


:: WontKiss
"Hell. No." you grumble. You brush off the meat drippings from your chest.

You make your way the cave entrance. "PEACE"

"Wait!" the Raccoon King motions you back. "Have you ever really finished anything?"

Raccoon King is making you feel like shit.

You pick yourself up off the sand and hail a water taxi. You take it back to your apartment and open up your macbook.

"That gross meat video is blowing up!" you utter. You check your [[Kickstarter|KickstarterWin]]


:: StayHere
You spend the next few days lounging around the trash pile. By now you've forgotten about the Kickstarter.

"More [[Get Huge|ItsPBR]] drink?" a raccoon asks in a butlery tone.

You nod. You take a few sips from the solo cup and glance over to the Raccoon King. He's splorging on some peanut butter. He stops for a moment "PB is like PBR for raccoons!"

You laugh out loud. You adjust the rotty meat steaks that are strapped to your chest.

The End.

"I saw your blog. It's practically dead."

You look down at the floor. You are not feeling Huge right now.
